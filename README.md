# SplitBill
This is simple billing split application intend to learn SwiftUI.
In this project I learn about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation stacks and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State and @FocusState property wrappers, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach. Even better, you have a real project to show off for your efforts.
